My Assignment for Game Engines 1

I plan to build a program that will intake audio, and then use that data to create procedural visuals. I plan to use this as a visual in 
the background of DJing at my own gigs and parties. I am very passionate about this and will continue to work on this project long after   
the semester is over. I would also like to combine this with a procedural infinite tunnel. The start will begin in the tunnel and go through
it. after some time passes it exits the tunnel and shows some sort of audio visualiser, then after time goes back into the tunnel. 

I have looked at some audio visualizers in youtube which use unity and in the past i have also used a visualizer on an old video editing 
tool when i was younger. I also looked at some of the previous years projects and i hope to draw inspiration from some of the linked ones 
below

videos i found on YT

Description of what you did


What you are most proud of about the assignment


What resources were useful for you (websites, tutorials, assets etc)


Embed a youtube video of your assignment. I recommend doing Build and Run from Unity so that the video looks at its best and running anc capturing at 1080P.
You can use Windows + ALt + R on Windows, or QuickTime player on the mac or use OBS on Linux to capture video
